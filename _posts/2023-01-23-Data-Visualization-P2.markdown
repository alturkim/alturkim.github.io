# Dataset
The dataset is a world development indicators dataset containing annual data about 217 countries covering the period from 1990 to 2014. The data is a compiled version from multiple sources from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator).

# Summary
The aim of the project is to study global historical trends by building a coherent narrative around the data through a **Change Over Time** story. The story describes how GDP growth changes across time and regions.
# Design
The story features five snapshots that are described by a sequential narrative on the text tabs showing above the visualizations. The story provides a finer control through time by using a time slider that allows for navigating to any year covered by the data. Finally, the seven regions in the data are color coded for clarity.
