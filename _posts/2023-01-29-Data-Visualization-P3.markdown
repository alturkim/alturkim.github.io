# Dataset
The dataset is a world development indicators dataset containing annual data about 217 countries covering the period from 1990 to 2014. The data is a compiled version from multiple sources from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator).

# Summary
This project tells the story of the relationship between **GDP** and **Power Consumption** through an **animated Bubble Chart**. The Bubble Charts is inspired by the late **Hans Rosling** Famous [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en). The story features three snapshots of the data that follows the change of power consumption of multiple countries like Saudi Arabia, Korea and Singapore as their GDPs change.
# Design
The story is designed by [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), a web-based visualization tool. The story narrated and animated and can be view in a video format in the link below. The story provides a finer control through time by using a time slider that allows for navigating to any year covered by the data. Finally, the seven regions in the data are color coded for clarity.
